# Company Efficiency Analysis (N & M Metrics)

Python program for calculating and visualizing cost dynamics and sales efficiency based on historical CSV data. The software analyzes financial indicators of companies from 2008 to 2025.

📌 **Problem Description**
The script reads a database of companies and calculates two key parameters for business financial health assessment:
1. **Parameter N (Cost Increase)**: Reflects the year-on-year change in a company's absolute costs (the difference between revenue and profit).
2. **Parameter M (Efficiency Ratio)**: Shows the ratio of revenue growth to cost increase. It helps understand how much additional revenue is generated by each unit of cost invested.

🧮 **Mathematical Model**
For each pair of consecutive years ($t-1$ and $t$), the following indicators are calculated:
• Costs: $Costs = Sales - Profit$
• X-Axis (N): 
$$N = (Sales_t - Profit_t) - (Sales_{t-1} - Profit_{t-1})$$
• Y-Axis (M): 
$$M = \frac{Sales_t - Sales_{t-1}}{N}$$

🚀 **Features**
• **Flexible Selection**: User enters the company name manually.
• **Dynamic Range**: Data filtering within the 2008–2025 period.
• **Error Handling**: Protection against division by zero and missing data for specific years.
• **Visualization**: Interactive scatter plot with trend lines and period labels.

🛠 **Requirements & Installation**
The script requires `pandas` (optional) and `matplotlib` libraries.

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/vash-login/company-efficiency-analysis.git
```
2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install matplotlib
```
3. Prepare data:
Place your `export_dataset.csv` file in the folder specified in the `FOLDER_PATH` variable inside the script. The file must have the following columns:
`rank, name, country, sales, profit, asset, market_value, year, id`.

📊 **Example**
After running the program, enter the company name. You will get a table like this:

| Year Pair | N (Costs) | M (Effect) |
|-----------|-----------|------------|
| 2018-2019 | 1500.00   | 1.2540     |
| 2019-2020 | -200.00   | 0.8500     |
